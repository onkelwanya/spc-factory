# SPC Factory for World of Darkness Game System in Foundry VTT

## Introduction

This module aims to help storytellers to quickly generate storyteller characters (SPCs) for their Vampire: The Masquerade 5. Edition games.
If you have ever run into the problem, that your players suddenly decide to do something you have not expected and you urgently need a SPC, you are just like me. To help me deal with this problem, I have made this little module.
It uses ChatGPT to generate a SPC in only a few seconds and creates a storyteller character sheet with the results. The sheet will have:
- A generated name (unless you provide one yourself)
- Standard and exceptional dice pools
- General difficulties
- Disciplines (if the generated character is a vampire or ghoul)
- List of personality and behavioral traits
- A small background of the character

## Requirements and Compatibility

This module is specifically written for the World of Darkness game system (INSERT URL) for FoundryVTT. It will not work with another system.
Also to use this module, you need to be able to use the ChatGPT API, which at the moment is not offered free of charge by OpenAI.

Currently you can only generate Vampire, Ghoul and Mortal SPCs.
